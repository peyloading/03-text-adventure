Project: text adventure
Peer's repository: https://github.com/nyx-19/03-text-adventure-2.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned  that she was able to use the same verbs to lead her around to different destinations.
I created new verbs for every action when it looks like I could have used them more than once and just changed the destination.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
She split up her endings making it more than just a final destination you assume to be the end to a genuine ending. This was
I think a part of the greater code that she worked off as a template, but I still liked it and would want to use it myself.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
no, her code was solid. There weren't any issues since this project was only about entering script and linking rooms.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
her code is self explanatory
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
No, it mostly made sense to me. lines 44 through 52 of the game engine file were a bit confusing.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Maybe explain what the commands she used do? I'm not sure if that would be required for the readme.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
It was impressive for her to use the more complicated code to make her game with knowing
