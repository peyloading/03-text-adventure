Project: Peer Review Text Adventure
Peer's repository: Peyton Conner



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned that the file main.py did not run when I selected run file in terminal due to an indentation error.
However, I did not not know how to fix this error. I also learned how if and elif statements can be used in the game engine with 
functions. That is something I struggled to do for my game. 

 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
The use of functions in my peers project definitely allowed for more complexity in the game and therefore, more interest and fun. 
I wish I knew how to impliment functions in my text adventure game at the time. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I would suggest including a begining to the game and story. Some sort of welcome or greeting that would make the user/player prepared for the game. 
The begining was a bit unexpected. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Instructions on how to play the game could have been clearer. Since there were many responses the player could have chosen, it 
would have helped to lay out some instructions. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Yes, I don't understand how to use the render, update, input functions so I couldn't understand the code although it appears 
consistent, thoughtout and accurate. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes it does. Well done!
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
He/she could have added more about the game. I couldn't figure out how to play the game and how to explore the many rooms. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Well done!
I like your squiggly brackets inside your print statements.
